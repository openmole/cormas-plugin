# OpenMole - Cormas plugin

## Cormas presentation

Cormas is an Agents Based Simulation platform, Focus on models for natural renewable resource management. Cormas, is oriented towards the representation of interactions and point of view between stakeholders about the use of natural renewable resources.

Cormas is a simulation platform based developed in SmallTalk on the pharo programming environment. Using power of Smalltalk and a pur free software philosophical approach under pharo Cormas allows the development of applications in object-oriented programming approach. Cormas pre-defined entities are SmallTalk generic classes from which, by specialization and refining, users can create specific entities for their own model.

## How To install it ?

Plugin compilation is automatically generated by Jenkins. You can download the pre-build plugin [here](https://jenkins.iscpif.fr/job/cormas-plugin-8dev/). Once you have run the service, you can load the `cormas-task_XX.jar` as plugin.

## How it work

OpenMole will interact with Pharo/Cormas using JSON formalism. Using OpenMole, you will generate from the task or from sampling methods as many files as need.
Each JSON files will be sent within a docker container with Pharo/Cormas. Each instance of this container will run a model and openMole will wait for results.

Those results will be formed in JSON and send back from the docker file to OpenMole where data will be serialized and instanced as an aggregation of openMole variable.  

## How to use it ?
Once you have load `cormas-task_XX.jar` you will be able to interact whit pharo/cormas.
